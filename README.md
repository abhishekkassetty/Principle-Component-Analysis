# PCA

PCA stands for principle component Analysis

PCA is used for dimensionality reduction

PCA works on the concept of maximizing the vaiance of the projected data points


# steps to perform PCA

consider a matrix Xnxd.

1.standardise the columns

2.caluclate the covariance of matrix
        
        Adxd = X.T*X

3.caluculate the eigen values and eigen vectors of the covariance matrix A
        
        1.eigen values tells us how the data is spread
        2.eigen vectors tells us the direction of variance

4.select the principal components(consider larger values)


# Limitations of PCA

1.PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

2.Ind√©pendant variables become less interpretable

3.sometimes we may loss Information as we are selecting vectors with larger values
